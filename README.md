# Neo Sustainable Exchange (NSE) - Frontend Prototype

## Project Overview
This repository contains the frontend prototype of the **Neo Sustainable Exchange (NSE)**, a tokenized securities platform dedicated to ESG-compliant and halal-aligned assets.

The current version is built under a **Mock First** strategy:
- 100% frontend navigable.
- No backend or authentication logic yet.
- Focused on scalability, modularity, and clean UX.

Future versions will incorporate backend integrations, trading engines, and compliance monitoring.
